# Tools

Tools provides a platform for smaller Admidio plugins.  Each plugin must be in a separate subfolder of Tools and the plugin name and folder name must be identical.

### Installation and Update

1. Create a folder named 'Tools' under adm_plugins
2. Copy all plugin files into this folder (If the folder already exists, you only need to replace all the files within it.)
3. To install or update, run the following PHP file: .../adm_plugins/Tools/system/install.php
